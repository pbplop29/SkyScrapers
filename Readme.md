## Tech

ScyScrapers uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- [BeautifulSoup] - Beautiful Soup is a Python library for pulling data out of HTML and XML files.
- [Selenium] - Selenium is for automating web applications for testing purposes.

And of course SkyScrapers itself is open source with a [public repository][dill]
on GitHub.

## Installation

SkyScrapers requires [Python's] latest version to run.

Install the dependencies before start.
